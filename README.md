# scripts
An assortment of scripts I do use either private or at work

### cwt.sh
Used to display the current time at work. According to German law, the employee is granted 45 minutes of break after 9 hours of work.  
This script checks the login time by using the last-command to get the time of start of the os and calculates the current time off of it.
The Result is the current time (minus the break) and the break-duration of that day.
